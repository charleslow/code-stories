# Test Queries

These queries are used to test the code-stories CLI during prompt optimization.
Each query tests a different aspect of story generation quality.

## Query 1: Simple flow
How does the CLI parse command-line arguments and start generating a story?

## Query 2: Multi-file flow
How does the 5-stage prompt system work from exploration to final JSON output?

## Query 3: External integration
How does the tool clone and analyze remote GitHub repositories?

## Query 4: Error handling
How does the tool handle failures during story generation?

## Query 5: Data transformation
How does a user's question get transformed into the final story.json output?
